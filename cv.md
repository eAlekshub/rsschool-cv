### About me:

Recently I’ve discovered the gratification and challenges associated with website design. Many aspects of front-end development are related to some of my hobbies and interests which are communication networking, computer science, and imaginative creation. This is why I’ve decided to pursue it as a career opportunity. Each day I work to get closer to achieving this goal by developing my base skills as well as learning new techniques. Creating something and seeing it progress from nothing gives me the pleasure and energy to continue. Seeing how changes and improvements can affect the final result of my work always inspires me during creation and development.
